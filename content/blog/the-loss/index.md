I remember this boy, crying, with his head on the wooden floor and his arms shakingly grabbing his knees. Screaming *“why”* endlessly.

I would like to take a piece of his pain, to ease him a bit.

Then my body is starting to fall under the weight of the gravity; taking chairs, tables, even the floor with it. 

I feel the frozen matter around my neck.<br>
I shiver all over.<br>
I close my eyes.<br> 

I am this boy.<br>
And I am crying now.

<em>(This post is not a declaration of war)</em>

I keep reflecting on my past few years (seven) working for web startups. Asking myself what problems my brain tried to solves while making web-apps and servers for businesses, but the answer is almost none. In fact, I was mostly using libraries and frameworks to get the job done.

But you know what? I don’t like having to learn and use libraries in order to complete a specific work. Nether architecting my entire codebase around frameworks that tells me to split my code in an infinite number of files of 10 fucking lines. *“Don’t reinvent the wheel”* they said, but we keep learning again and again how to use this fucking wheel. We should make our programs from persistent knowledge, not short time best-practices.

Despite billions of people using websites every day, web clients aren’t designed for today’s usage. To me, it’s a weird paradox; we’re developing programs that target only one “platform” (the browser) so it should be straightforward but instead, we're consuming a tremendous amount of tools and frameworks created for only one goal: hacking the browser API.

Try making rich and complex web-app without any third-party packages and you’re going right in hell. The *dom api* is a complete mess, and we’re trying to hide it with an infinite pile of libraries. And jeez I didn’t talk about deploying web-apps…

Ladies and gentlemen, I am ashamed.

Sometimes, in the late evening, watching the stars; I’m caught dreaming about ourselves re-designing the entire stack, from the client to the server, with new perspectives and strong ambitions.

Because in the end, it’s just data with cpu instructions sent to another cpu.

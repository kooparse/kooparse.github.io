<b>You</b>

<b>Stop</b> not trusting yourself, or thinking you aren’t smart or good enough, or you haven’t had enough experiences, or you don’t have the time or you simply can’t do it.

A cool dude once said: <i>“Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you.”</i>

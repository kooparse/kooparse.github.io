        Hello, my name is Alexandre ChÃªne!
        <br />I am an independant software engineer.
        <br />
        <br />I love coding for mostly one reason: It gives me a limitless
        power to create whatever I have in my head. There is such a powerful
        feeling that comes from creating something out of nothing.
        <br />
        <br />I am 200% on game dev right now. Working mostly by myself.
        <br />
        <br />
